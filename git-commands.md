###Useful git commands
- git status - show what happens inside repository - current status
- git log - show history of repository

### Git rules
- working directory should be clean when we travel between commits and branches
- every time we work on new task we should use new branch
- git status shows what's going on in local repository, and git fetch shows what's going on remote repositories
