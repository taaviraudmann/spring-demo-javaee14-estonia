### Building program steps
- Requirements
  - Business requirements - what application should do?
    - identify initial requirements
    - work on details of initial requirements
  - Technical requirements - technology stack (which framework/languages should we use?)
    - Translation of business requirements into technical ones

### Notes - application
    - Business requirements:
        - storing and managing (add/edit) notes
        - adding extra stuff to notes
        - status - (new/in progress/done)
        - reminders about dates

### Steps for adding reservations (JSON)
- data structure for information to send - how to translate it?
- controller with endpoint
- service for processing the data 
- repository
- database table
- what to send in response to the client?
